    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>As a young boy I wanted to be a karate teacher. Unfortunately, I had a temper and my parents didn't trust me
        with karate moves until I was about 11. By then I was quickly approaching the age where karate stopped being 
        cool, so after a year or two of karate I bailed on that dream.  By the time I hit college I didn't know what 
        I wanted to do but after a semester or two I settled on Industrial Engineering because it was safe, semi-lucrative,
        and (in theory) would provide me an opportunity to travel some.  I graduated and worked a bit but quickly decided
        that was for the birds and that the traveling was the only attractive part. So I stopped and took off to travel and teach.
        After a few years of that I thought that this was fine and all but not lucrative at all and I was gonna die poor.
        So I went back to the drawing board and decided that software development was the perfect hybrid-best-of-both-worlds
        solution to all my problems.
